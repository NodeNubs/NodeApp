## Torrent site
We have to make 15 different web pages with at least four tables

 1. Home page - some bs information about us/links to login/register, some table idk for all users or something.
 2. Login.
 3. Register.
 4. Profile management page.
 5. Torrent file upload page(users can add tors).
 6. Torrent files management page(where users can look thru all the files they submitted and edit/delete).
 7. Categories page (for the torrents-music/video etc).
 8. Main torrents page - giant table like in zamunda :), supporting filtering and paging of the files.
 9. Specific torrent file page - info, pictures, comments etc.
 10. Admin special page - list(table) of all the users/tors. Admins can delete users/tors.
 11. About us page.

So... 10 pages so far
